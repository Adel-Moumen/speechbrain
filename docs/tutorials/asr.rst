Do you want to figure out how to implement your speech recognizer with SpeechBrain? Look no further, you're in the right place. This tutorial will walk you through all the steps needed to implement an offline end-to-end attention-based speech recognizer. This is a self-contained tutorial that will help you "connecting the dots" across all the steps needed to train a modern speech recognizer. We will address data preparation, tokenizer training, language model, ASR model, and inference. We will explain how to train your model on your data.
